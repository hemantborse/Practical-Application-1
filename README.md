# Practical-Application-1 - 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

## Problem statemant

Find out different patterns/ analysis of different type of drivers accepted ot rejected coupons and what are factors affecting their decision?
The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.


## Notebook code :

## Details :
This project analyses data,statistical summarizatiom and data visulization techniques are used to understand drivers/customers accepting coupons Vs who do not and other factors impacting on acceptance of coupons.


I used quite a few things which I learned from Module 1 to Module 4 in this course.
first importing all necessary libraris such as Pandands,Seaborn,matplotlib and numpy
extensive use of pandas to read / create dataset followed by

    1) Identifying null values and deciding to drop or replace values - I used both
    
    2) Converting String type Age Column in to Int
    
    3) Cleaning / convering Age Column data in meaning ful data for rows having text values.
    
    4) Use of Seanborn library to plot barplots to analyse data
    
    5) arithmatic and statistical functions to calculate and analyse data.

Conclusion of this assignment / analysis of data is - 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Bar Coupons :**
1) Frequency of bar Visit : Drives who go more than once to bar largely accpeted bar coupons
2) Passenger impact : it is clear that Adult passengers with no kids as passengers also largely accepted coupons
3) Passenger occupations : frequency to visit morethan ones with no kids as passenger plus occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry largely accpeted coupons
4) Income impact and restaurant spending : drivers going to cheap restaurants and income less than 50K are on on lower side of acceptance of coupons

**Coffee Coupons :**
1) overall coffee hous coupon acceptace is half and half i.e 50%
2) Frequency of visits : Drivers who visited coffee house more than once has higher rate of coupoun acceptance
3) Temprature impact : looking at percentage , tempratures do not make that big of a difference in acceptance rate
